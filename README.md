# Webex and Dogs and cats API

Webex bot in python, when active it listens in a certain channel on webex and looks for commands and reply's with happy cats or dogs.


The API group was very supportive for this script ! so props to them.


If anybody wants to use it feel free ! Just dont forget to add your own webex token and Key from the guys at https://thedogapi.com/
